There are no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**Time to close:** There are 256 positive unique values between 76 and 518, matching the descirption given. There are no missing values. No changes were made to this column. \n\n**Claim amount:** There are 2000 unique values, but all of these values were stored as objects with the currency symbol in front of the amount. There are no missing values. The values were truncated to remove the currency symbol and the data type was changed to numerical values.  \n\n**Amount paid:** There are 1963 unique values between 1516.73 and 52498.75 that match the descrption given. There were 36 missing values. Missing values were replaced with the median value of 20105.70. \n\n**Location:** There are four unique values matching the description given. There are no missing values. No changes were made to this column. \n\n**Individuals on claim:** There are 15 unique values between 1 and 15, matching the description given. There are no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**Linked cases:** All of the values in this column were either TRUE or FALSE. There were 26 missing values. Missing values were replaced with FALSE. \n\n**Cause:** There were five unique values in this column instead of the expected three. Two mistakes were identified. The value 'meat' was replaced with the value ' Meat' 14 times total, with four instances at Sao Luis, eight instances at Recife, and two instances at Fortaleza. The value 'vegetable' was replaced with the value 'VEGETABLES' 16 times total, with five instances at Sao Luis, eight instances at Recife, one instance at Fortaleza, and two instances at Natal. There are no missing values. All instances of the two mistakes were replaced with the identified correct value.

The categories are unbalanced. Recife handled the most cases with just under half the total claims. Sao Luis handled just over a fourth of the total claims. Fortaleza and Natal together handled just over a fourth of the total. Recife handled 885 claims, Sao Luis handled 517 claims, Fortaleza handled 311 claims, and Natal handled 287 claims.

Your answer must include a visualization that shows the distribution.\n\n![time to close boxplot](time_to_close_box.png)\n\nAbove is our first distribution of time it takes to close claims. The box plot shows that most claims are concentrated between 158 and 204, our first and third quartiles respectivly. The green triangle resprenting our mean of 185.568 is to the right of our median of 179, which is expected due to the amount of outliers giving our graph a right skew. There are 114 outliers above the calculated maximum of 273 and 6 outliers below the calulated minimum of 89 with the fastest time of 76 days. These 114 outliers are a good place to identify causes of long time to close claims for the legal team. Analysis into these ourliers is provided at the end of this task section. \n\n![time to close histogram](time_to_close_histogram.png)\n\nThe histogram above shows another look at how the distribution of the graph is concentrated. The number of days taken spikes around our median value. Around the spike the number of days starts to taper off without any big jumps in number of days. We can again see the right skew of the graph as the tail extends towards the longest claim duration of 518 days.\n\nWe can further analyze the 114 outliers to the right of our boxplot based on the other catagories of the data to find correlations that might cause these outliers. All categories avaialble were investigated. None of the outlier claims are linked to other cases and have a slightly higher average claim amount and amound paid then all claims had, but there wasn't enough there to identify a cause for long time to close. Below we'll see the outliers broken down by claim cause, individuals on claim, and location.\n\n![cause table](cause_table.png)\n\nWe can see above that of the 114 outliers, 74 claims had an unknown cause, 38 had meat as the cause, and only 2 had the vegetables as the cause. The interesting information here is that claims with vegetables as the cause are rarely taking long times to close. If the legal team can identify why vegetable claims are different, that information might be useful for reducing overall claim times.\n\n![Individuals on claim table](IoC_table.png)\n\nHere we can see as more individuals get added to a claim, the more likely the claim has an abnormally long time to close. 24.24% of all the claims with 15 individuals have abnormally long time to close. 99 of the 114 outliers are claims with 10 or more individuals on the claim. This may also be a good place for the legal team to look to reduce the time to close claims. \n\n![location table](location_table.png)\n\nAt first glance, it looks like Recife and Sao Luis have most of the abnormally long claims, but if we compare this with our findings from Task 2, Recife and Sao Luis have substantionally more claims being processed. It seems that the rate of outliers doesn't change between locations as the percentage of total outliers at each location is consistant with the percentage of total claims processed at each location. We will verify if this relationship between time to close and location applies to the rest of the data in the final task. \n","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the relationship between time to close and location. Your answer must include a visualization to demonstrate the relationship. \n \n\n![location_box_plots](location_box_plots.png)\n\nIn the figure above, we can see that the time to close doesn't have large variations based on the locations claims are based at. The average time for all locations is just over 175 days and the data has similar spread between all locations. This is consistant with the findings in Task 3 where we identified that the existence of outliers with abornmally long claim times isn't significantly affected by location. \n\nBased on our findings, for the legal team to reduce the time it takes to proccess claims, they should not look at the differences between location. Instead, the team should investigate ways to reduce the number of individuals on a claim or identify why vegetable claims have less abnormally long processing times.
