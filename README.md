These folders contains data analyst projects I've completed. Projects are currently broken into 3 catagories:

DataScience contains the 6 homework assignments for my data science class taken at UNO, along with my groups final project. 
  These were coded in R using Rstudio. I have the Rmd with the code along with the pdf of the created markdown. 
  
Freecodecamp contains the projects completed for my data analysis with python certificate.
  There are 5 projects completed for this certification. These projects were all coded in Python using Replit. The code I created is in the function .py file named after the project. 
  
DataCamp contains the project I completed for my Associate Data Analyst certification exam.
  I used replit to code in python and created a jupytr markdown file in the datacamp workspace. The visualizations of the graphs in the markdown are all here as well as png files.
